# SQL-PowerBI-Project
The company is experiencing a wave of employee resignations. My responsibility is to analyze the data and identify key insights to understand the underlying causes

# CONCLUSION
1. Focus of the analysis:
- The analysis specifically targets the following employee segments:
- Gender: Male
- Age group: 26–35 years old
- Marital status: Single
- Departments: Human Resources (HR) and Research & Development (R&D)
- Educational background: Life Sciences
- Education level: Level 3
- Job roles: Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive
- Workload: Frequently required to work overtime (OT)
- Salary slab: Up to $5,000+
- Total working experience: 1 to 6 years
- Years in current role: 0 or 2 years
- Work-life balance rating: Level 3
  
2. Recruitment considerations:
The company should reassess the strategy of hiring a large number of employees aged 26–35, particularly in the HR and R&D departments, as well as the high intake of candidates with a background in Life Sciences.

3. Compensation vs. workload imbalance:
It is crucial to investigate why employees aged 25–40 have significantly longer working hours but earn lower salaries compared to the 18–25 age group. The mismatch between compensation and workload is likely a major factor contributing to attrition—especially given that the 26–35 age group shows the highest resignation rate.

4. Retention strategy for key departments:
There is a need to develop targeted recruitment and retention policies specifically for employees in the HR and R&D departments.

5. Pre-hire assessment of commute distance:
The company should consider evaluating the distance between an applicant’s home and the workplace before making a hiring decision, as younger employees with long commutes are at higher risk of early resignation.

6. Review overtime (OT) policies:
A thorough review of the company’s OT policy is necessary to ensure it does not contribute to burnout or dissatisfaction.

7. Salary slab concern:
Although employees in the “Up to $5K+” salary slab receive the highest percentage of salary increases, they also show a high turnover rate. The company should assess whether the time required to qualify for a raise is too long, potentially leading to frustration and resignation.

8. Targeted raise and retention policies:
Special salary increment and retention programs should be considered for employees with total working experience of 1–6 years and those who have spent 1–3 years in their current role.
